This project helps the user varieties of meals that he/she can make with given ingredients that they have. 
One just have to enter whatever ingredients they have, this project will provide them with different dishes that can be made using those ingredients. 
Not only that, it will also show the recipes for all the dishes mentioned for the ease of the user to make what they crave. 
Furthermore, it also provides a youtube link for the whole making of a particular meal decided by the user. One can then easily follow the steps provided and cook the best from what they have.

I have used an API called TheMealDB API, which provides me data like different meals, recipes, tags and video tutorials in Json format.
